### Description:

In a world where job hunting has become more challenging and employers are investing less time in finding the right employees, being unique is the key to securing a job easily. With this perspective in mind, I had the idea of creating a personal portfolio to capture the interest of employers and increase my chances of being hired for suitable positions with a good salary. Employers are increasingly interested in seeing the qualifications of potential candidates, which a well-crafted portfolio can provide.
Based on this concept, I decided to build my own website and design it to align with the theme of a professional portfolio. There are several reasons for this choice:

1. Professional Identity: A personal website allows me to establish a strong professional identity.
2. Easy Navigation: The website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
3. Easy Development and Updates: Maintaining and updating the website is straightforward.

As we know, a portfolio can provide all of the above benefits and more if created properly. It goes beyond the traditional CV format and offers a unique experience by showcasing our work and skills. By surprising potential employers with interesting features in our portfolio, we can effectively demonstrate our abilities. Additionally, updating our personal works and expertise becomes much simpler, as we only need to make changes in one place, rather than dealing with photocopies and other hassles. Moreover, job hunters often seek specific talents or skills, and by presenting our experience in this way, they can easily navigate through our portfolio and find the desired information, increasing their interest in us as a candidate.

As a personal contribution, I made an effort to imitate a teacher's portfolio and included my personal information virtually to fulfill all the necessary requirements. I hope to further develop and host this website online, as it can benefit me in my personal and professional life.

### **How it is made**

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program consists of two files: one for HTML, which incorporates JavaScript, and another for CSS. Starting with the HTML concept, I created a user interface with four containers, each displaying different content that may interest the reader. The reader can effortlessly navigate through these containers by clicking on the desired one in the header layout.

I wrote JavaScript scripts that serve three main functions. First, they enable the ability to switch between Dark and Light mode themes on the website. Second, they display the text of the selected category among skills, experience, and education. Lastly, I used online code from GitHub to connect the user's message in the contact section to Google Sheets, allowing me to access it anytime as it is recorded there.

Regarding the design, I mostly tried to replicate designs I came across online. Since website creation is not a new concept, there are established standards and dimensions that make pages look more attractive and professional. Personally, I drew inspiration from existing websites to save time. As a programmer, I believe I shouldn't spend too much time on visual design, as that is the work of a designer. I also made changes to my code after watching a YouTube video, as it seemed more appealing to me."
